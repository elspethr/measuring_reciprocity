# measuring_reciprocity

This repository contains the code to reproduce the analyses and figures/table in the paper:

Ready, E. and Power, E.A. 2021. Measuring Reciprocity: Double Sampling, Concordance, and Network Construction.

The networks from each dataset are generated in "processing" data files. These are aggregated and networks measures presented in the paper are calculated in the file "compiling.R". 

The R file "paper_figtabs.R" sources the compiling file and generates Figure 2â€“4 and Tables 1, 2, S2, and S3. File "microfinance_ERGMs.R" runs the multilevel ERGMs and produces Figure 5. Note that the ERGMs take considerable time to run.
